 Markdown Previewer

 This is a project made by myself as a freecodecamp project submission. It is an Markdown-Previewer using markedown API given by freecodecamp itself.
 
 Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. It is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. And this does it quite well.
